## Build Week Group Project ##

### Build the HTML/CSS/JS Marketing Page / User Interface for Website ###

My role in the group was 'User Interface Developer', where my goals were:

* Build a multi-page marketing website that matches the theme chosen by my group and provides the user with details about the product our team has selected to build.

* Marketing website must include responsive mobile and desktop screen widths.

* The call to action on the website should be a login button that links the user over to the React application that our Front End Architect built.

* Marketing website must be hosted on a hosting platform like “Netlify” or “Github Pages”.

* Marketing site’s home page should have content and copy that relates to the product that our team worked on.

* For a second page, create an 'about us' section that includes images of the members of our team, and links to one another’s socials/Github.

__Pitch:__ As an expat, I want to be able to show off the places I've been and remember them for myself. I have a lot of amazing pics and stories from around the world I'd like to share, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so.

__MVP:__ User can visit site and see photos laid out in a grid, travelers can create, read, update, and delete stories and photos. (No ability to upload one's own photos for MVP.)

__Stretch Goal:__ Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own assets. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary.)
